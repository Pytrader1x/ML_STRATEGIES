# AUDUSD Strategy Validation Report

## Executive Summary

**Date Generated:** June 12, 2025  
**Currency Pair:** AUDUSD  
**Testing Framework:** Monte Carlo Simulation with Anti-Cheating Validation

### üö® Critical Findings

1. **Random Entry Performance Too High**: Random entries achieving Sharpe ratios around 1.0-1.2, which is unusually high
2. **Unrealistic Trade Statistics**: Average wins of 1307% and losses of -1446% indicate a calculation error
3. **Excessive Returns**: Returns of 500-600% in recent months are not realistic for forex trading

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Performance Across Time Periods

#### Configuration 1: Ultra-Tight Risk Management
- **2015-2017**: Sharpe 1.31, Return 173%, Win Rate 70%
- **2018-2020**: Sharpe 1.03, Return 99%, Win Rate 71%
- **2021-2023**: Sharpe 1.31, Return 150%, Win Rate 70%
- **2024-2025**: Sharpe 1.16, Return 120%, Win Rate 70%

#### Configuration 2: Scalping Strategy
- **2015-2017**: Sharpe 1.82, Return 173%, Win Rate 65%
- **2018-2020**: Sharpe 1.53, Return 133%, Win Rate 64%
- **2021-2023**: Sharpe 1.79, Return 198%, Win Rate 62%
- **2024-2025**: Sharpe 1.81, Return 148%, Win Rate 65%

### 2. Red Flags Identified

#### üî¥ Issue 1: Random Entry Baseline
- Random entries achieving Sharpe ratios of 0.88-1.24
- This suggests the backtest may be using future information
- Normal random entries should produce Sharpe ratios near 0 or negative

#### üî¥ Issue 2: Trade Size Calculations
- Average win: 1307.24% (impossible for individual forex trades)
- Average loss: -1445.69% (impossible - max loss should be 100%)
- These numbers indicate a bug in the P&L calculation

#### üî¥ Issue 3: Recent Performance
- June 2024-Present returns of 522-628%
- This would turn $100k into $622k-$728k in just one year
- Unrealistic for any legitimate forex strategy

### 3. Potential Issues

1. **Look-Ahead Bias**: The strategy may be using future price information
2. **Calculation Errors**: Trade P&L calculations appear to be incorrect
3. **Position Sizing Issues**: May be compounding positions unrealistically
4. **Data Quality**: Possible issues with the underlying price data

### 4. Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix P&L Calculations**: Review how individual trade profits/losses are calculated
2. **Verify Data Integrity**: Check for gaps, bad prices, or corrupted data
3. **Review Signal Generation**: Ensure indicators don't use future information
4. **Test with Realistic Constraints**: Add proper slippage, spreads, and commissions

#### Code Review Needed:
- Position sizing logic
- Entry/exit signal generation
- Stop loss and take profit calculations
- Equity curve calculation

### 5. Conclusion

**‚ùå VALIDATION FAILED**

The strategy shows multiple signs of implementation errors or look-ahead bias:
- Impossible trade statistics
- Unrealistic returns
- Random entries performing too well

**This strategy should NOT be traded with real money until these issues are resolved.**

## Next Steps

1. Debug the trade P&L calculation code
2. Implement proper anti-look-ahead checks
3. Add realistic trading costs (spread, slippage, commissions)
4. Re-run validation after fixes
5. Consider paper trading for extended period before live trading

*Note: This validation was performed using standard anti-cheating techniques including random entry baselines, out-of-sample testing, and statistical analysis. The results strongly suggest implementation issues that must be addressed.*
