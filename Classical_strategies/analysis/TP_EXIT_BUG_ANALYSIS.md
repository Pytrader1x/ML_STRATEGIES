# Take Profit Exit Bug Analysis

## Summary of Issues Found

### 1. Over-Exiting Bug (Critical) 🚨

**Issue**: The strategy is exiting more than the position size.

**Example**: Trade 5121623008
- Entry: 3M position
- Exit 1: 0.99M (33% of 3M) ✓
- Exit 2: 0.99M (33% of 3M) ❌ Should be 33% of 2.01M = 0.663M
- Exit 3: 0.99M (33% of 3M) ❌ 
- Exit 4: 0.99M (33% of 3M) ❌
- **Total Exit: 3.96M on a 3M position!**

**Root Cause**: In `_execute_full_exit` method, the code calculates:
```python
exit_size = min(trade.position_size / 3, trade.remaining_size)
```
But it's still using `trade.position_size / 3` which is always 33% of the original size, not the remaining size.

**Fix Required**: 
```python
exit_size = min(trade.remaining_size / 3, trade.remaining_size)
# Or for proper 33.33% exits:
exit_size = trade.remaining_size * 0.3333
```

### 2. Confusing CSV Output

**Issue**: Trades show `exit_reason=take_profit_1` with `tp_hits=0` and `partial_exits=4`

**What's Really Happening**:
1. Trade enters and sets 3 TP levels
2. Price hits TP1 → Takes 33% profit → Continues
3. Price hits TP2 → Takes 33% profit → Continues  
4. Price hits TP3 → Takes final 33% → Trade completes
5. CSV shows final exit as `take_profit_1` (bug!) with `tp_hits=0` (not updated)

**Why This Happens**:
- The `tp_hits` counter is only updated during partial exits
- When the final TP exit completes the trade, `tp_hits` isn't saved
- The exit reason shows the TP level that caused the final exit, not all TPs hit

### 3. Logging Issues

**Current State**: 
- Only logs the final trade state
- Doesn't show the progression of partial exits
- Makes it impossible to track TP1 → TP2 → TP3 progression

**Solution Implemented**: 
Created `create_detailed_trade_action_log.py` which logs:
- Every ENTRY with size, price, SL/TP levels
- Every EXIT (partial or full) with size, P&L, reason
- Remaining position after each action

## Recommended CSV Structure

Instead of one row per trade, we should have:

### Option 1: Action-Based Log
```csv
timestamp,trade_id,action,action_num,direction,price,size,exit_type,pnl,cumulative_pnl,remaining_position
2025-02-03 03:15,12345,ENTRY,1,long,0.6145,3000000,,,0,3000000
2025-02-03 07:15,12345,EXIT,2,long,0.6155,1000000,TP1,898,898,2000000
2025-02-03 08:00,12345,EXIT,3,long,0.6159,1000000,TP2,1278,2176,1000000
2025-02-03 08:15,12345,EXIT,4,long,0.6163,1000000,TP3,1723,3899,0
```

### Option 2: Trade Summary with TP Details
```csv
trade_id,entry_time,entry_price,position_size,tp1_hit,tp1_size,tp1_pnl,tp2_hit,tp2_size,tp2_pnl,tp3_hit,tp3_size,tp3_pnl,final_exit,final_pnl
12345,2025-02-03 03:15,0.6145,3000000,true,1000000,898,true,1000000,1278,true,1000000,1723,TP3,3899
```

## Impact on Performance Metrics

The over-exiting bug means:
1. **P&L might be overstated** - We're calculating profits on phantom exits
2. **Position sizing is wrong** - Later exits use wrong sizes
3. **Risk metrics are incorrect** - We think we're risking X but actually risking more

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the over-exiting bug** in `Prod_strategy.py`
2. **Implement proper trade action logging** 
3. **Recalculate all performance metrics** after fixes
4. **Verify position sizes** match entries and exits exactly

## Verification Test

After fixes, every trade should satisfy:
```
Total Entry Size == Sum of All Exit Sizes
```

Currently failing trades show exits > entries, which is impossible in real trading.
