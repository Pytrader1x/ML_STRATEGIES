# üìä Trading Strategy Analysis Scripts

This directory contains all analysis scripts used to verify and analyze the trading strategies' performance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Scripts Overview

### üîç Exit Pattern Analysis Scripts

#### `analyze_exit_patterns.py`
Analyzes true exit patterns to understand how trades actually close.
```python
# Key outputs:
- Pure Stop Loss: Trades that hit SL without any partial exits

- Pure Take Profit: Trades that hit all 3 TP levels
- Exit pattern distribution and statistics
```

#### `analyze_sl_outcomes.py`
Deep analysis of stop loss outcomes - not all SL exits are losses!
```python
# Categorizes SL exits into:
- Loss: SL exit with P&L < -$50
- Breakeven: SL exit with -$50 ‚â§ P&L ‚â§ +$50
- Profit: SL exit with P&L > +$50 (TSL activated)
```

#### `analyze_trade_log.py`
Comprehensive trade-by-trade analysis with full metrics.
```python
# Analyzes:
- Entry/exit prices and times
- Position sizes and partial exits
- P&L in dollars and pips
- Trade duration and direction
```

### üèÉ Backtest Runner Scripts

#### `run_backtest_with_exit_stats.py`
Enhanced backtest that tracks detailed exit statistics.
```python
# Added tracking for:
- sl_outcome_stats: {sl_loss, sl_breakeven, sl_profit}
- exit_pattern_stats: {pure_sl, partial_then_sl, pure_tp}
- tp_hit_stats: {tp1_hits, tp2_hits, tp3_hits}
```

#### `run_backtest_with_trade_log.py`
Backtest with comprehensive trade logging for debugging.
```python
# Logs every trade action:
- ENTRY: price, size, indicators, confidence
- PARTIAL_EXIT: size, reason, P&L
- FINAL_EXIT: reason, total P&L, pips
```

#### `run_feb_march_2025.py`
Specific analysis for Feb-March 2025 period.
```python
# Date range: 2025-02-01 to 2025-03-31
# Runs both configurations
# Generates detailed CSV logs
```

### üìà Comprehensive Report Scripts

#### `run_comprehensive_report.py`
Main report generator with all performance metrics.
```python
# Generates:
- Performance metrics (Sharpe, returns, drawdown)
- Exit pattern analysis
- Stop loss outcome breakdown
- Take profit statistics
```

#### `deep_analysis_report.py`
Ultra-detailed analysis breaking down every aspect.
```python
# Deep dive into:
- Profitable trade patterns
- Loss analysis by type
- Risk/reward verification
- Sharpe ratio validation
```

#### `comprehensive_detailed_report.py`
Full report with position sizing verification.
```python
# Verifies:
- Position sizes (1M, 3M, 5M)
- Exit sizes match entries
- No over-exiting after bug fix
- Detailed P&L calculations
```

#### `final_tsl_clarification.py`
Clarifies the critical distinction between Pure SL and TSL.
```python
# Clear breakdown:
- Pure SL: Only losses (46.4% / 59.1%)
- TSL: Breakeven or profit (18.5% / 15.9%)
- Key insight: 20-30% of SL exits are profitable!
```

## üîë Key Discoveries

### 1. The Trailing Stop Loss (TSL) Effect
```
Traditional View: Stop Loss = Loss
Reality: 20-30% of SL exits are profitable!

How it works:
1. Trade enters at market
2. Price moves 15+ pips in favor
3. TSL activates, guaranteeing 5 pip minimum profit
4. If price reverses, exit at profit instead of loss
```

### 2. Position Sizing Verification
```
Bug Found & Fixed:
- Issue: Strategy was exiting 4M on 3M position
- Fix: Exit size = min(position_size/3, remaining_size)
- Result: All exits now correctly sized
```

### 3. Risk Management Excellence
```
Config 1: Max 10 pip SL ‚Üí Higher win rate (51.2%)
Config 2: Max 5 pip SL ‚Üí Better R:R (2.43:1)
Both: TSL activation at 15 pips ‚Üí Profit protection
```

### 4. Exit Pattern Insights
```
Most Profitable Pattern: Pure TP (all 3 levels hit)
Most Common Pattern: Pure SL for loss
Hidden Gem: Partial ‚Üí SL can still be profitable!
```
