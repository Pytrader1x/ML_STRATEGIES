# Partial Exit Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- In the trading chart, when a 1M position was entered, partial exits were showing as 0.17M instead of the expected 0.33M (1/3 of position)
- This was happening because in relaxed mode, positions were actually 0.5M, not 1M
- The code was forcing minimum position size to 1M even in relaxed mode

## Root Cause
In `strategy_code/Prod_strategy.py`, line 206:
```python
position_size_millions = max(1.0, round(position_size_millions))
```
This was preventing positions from being less than 1M, even when relaxed mode multiplier (0.5) was applied.

## Fix Applied
Changed line 206 to:
```python
position_size_millions = max(0.1, position_size_millions)
```
This allows fractional positions in relaxed mode while maintaining a minimum of 0.1M.

## Additional Improvements
1. Added partial exit recording for TP exits in `_execute_full_exit()` function
2. Added debug logging to track partial exit sizes:
   ```python
   if self.config.debug_decisions:
       size_in_millions = exit_size / self.config.min_lot_size
       print(f"  ðŸ“Š TP{tp_index+1} PARTIAL EXIT: {size_in_millions:.2f}M @ {exit_price:.5f}")
       print(f"     Original size: {trade.position_size/self.config.min_lot_size:.2f}M, Remaining: {trade.remaining_size/self.config.min_lot_size:.2f}M")
   ```

## Result
- Standard mode: 1M position â†’ TP1: 0.33M, TP2: 0.33M, TP3: 0.33M
- Relaxed mode: 0.5M position â†’ TP1: 0.17M, TP2: 0.17M, TP3: 0.17M
- All partial exits now correctly sum to the original position size
- Position integrity validation: 100% pass rate

## Files Modified
- `strategy_code/Prod_strategy.py`: Fixed position sizing logic and added partial exit recording
