## 📖 Detailed Strategy Explanation

### Strategy Overview

The trading strategies use three proprietary technical indicators to generate high-probability trading signals:

1. **NTI (Neuro Trend Intelligent)**: An EMA-based trend direction indicator with confirmation requirements
2. **MB (Market Bias)**: Heikin Ashi-based market structure analysis
3. **IC (Intelligent Chop)**: ATR-based market regime classification (Trend/Range/Chop)

### Entry Logic

**Standard Entry (All 3 indicators must align):**
- **LONG**: NTI_Direction = 1 AND MB_Bias = 1 AND IC_Regime in [1,2] (trending market)
- **SHORT**: NTI_Direction = -1 AND MB_Bias = -1 AND IC_Regime in [1,2] (trending market)

**Relaxed Entry (Config 1 only, when relaxed_mode=True):**
- **LONG**: NTI_Direction = 1 (NTI signal alone)
- **SHORT**: NTI_Direction = -1 (NTI signal alone)

### Configuration 1: Ultra-Tight Risk Management

**Purpose**: Maximize win rate with ultra-conservative risk per trade

**Key Parameters:**
```python
# Risk Management
initial_capital = 100,000
risk_per_trade = 0.002  # 0.2% risk per trade

# Stop Loss Settings
sl_max_pips = 10.0  # Maximum 10 pip stop loss
sl_atr_multiplier = 1.0  # 1x ATR for dynamic stops

# Take Profit Levels (3 tiers)
tp_atr_multipliers = (0.2, 0.3, 0.5)  # Very tight TPs
max_tp_percent = 0.003  # Max 0.3% price move

# Trailing Stop Logic
tsl_activation_pips = 3  # Activates after 3 pips profit
tsl_min_profit_pips = 1  # Guarantees 1 pip minimum
tsl_initial_buffer_multiplier = 1.0

# Market Adaptations
tp_range_market_multiplier = 0.5  # 50% tighter in ranging
tp_trend_market_multiplier = 0.7  # 30% tighter in trends
tp_chop_market_multiplier = 0.3  # 70% tighter in chop

# Exit Strategy
exit_on_signal_flip = False  # Hold through minor reversals
partial_profit_before_sl = True  # Take 50% at 50% to SL
```

**Trading Logic:**
1. Enter when all 3 indicators align (or NTI alone in relaxed mode)
2. Place ultra-tight stop loss (max 10 pips)
3. Set 3 take profit levels at 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 ATR
4. Exit 1/3 position at each TP level
5. Activate trailing stop after 3 pips profit
6. Take partial profit (50%) when price reaches 50% of SL distance
7. Hold remaining position until stop loss or final TP

### Configuration 2: Scalping Strategy

**Purpose**: High-frequency scalping with ultra-tight stops

**Key Parameters:**
```python
# Risk Management
initial_capital = 100,000
risk_per_trade = 0.001  # 0.1% risk per trade (half of Config 1)

# Stop Loss Settings
sl_max_pips = 5.0  # Maximum 5 pip stop loss
sl_atr_multiplier = 0.5  # 0.5x ATR for tighter stops

# Take Profit Levels (3 tiers)
tp_atr_multipliers = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)  # Ultra-tight scalping TPs
max_tp_percent = 0.002  # Max 0.2% price move

# Trailing Stop Logic
tsl_activation_pips = 2  # Activates after 2 pips profit
tsl_min_profit_pips = 0.5  # Guarantees 0.5 pip minimum
tsl_initial_buffer_multiplier = 0.5  # Tighter trailing

# Market Adaptations
tp_range_market_multiplier = 0.3  # 70% tighter in ranging
tp_trend_market_multiplier = 0.5  # 50% tighter in trends
tp_chop_market_multiplier = 0.2  # 80% tighter in chop

# Exit Strategy
exit_on_signal_flip = True  # Exit immediately on signal reversal
signal_flip_min_profit_pips = 0.0  # No minimum profit required
partial_profit_before_sl = True  # Take 70% at 30% to SL
```

**Trading Logic:**
1. Enter when all 3 indicators align
2. Place ultra-tight stop loss (max 5 pips)
3. Set 3 scalping TP levels at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 ATR
4. Exit 1/3 position at each TP level
5. Activate trailing stop after 2 pips profit
6. Take large partial profit (70%) when price reaches 30% of SL distance
7. Exit immediately if signals flip (momentum reversal)

### Key Strategy Features

#### Dynamic Market Regime Adaptation 🎯

The strategies automatically adjust take profit levels based on market conditions using the Intelligent Chop (IC) indicator:

**Market Regime Detection:**
- **Strong Trend (IC_Regime 1)**: Normal take profits
- **Weak Trend (IC_Regime 2)**: Slightly tighter take profits  
- **Ranging/Choppy (IC_Regime 3,4)**: Ultra-tight take profits

**Take Profit Adjustments by Market:**
```
Config 1 (Ultra-Tight Risk):
- Trending Market: TP1 = 0.14 ATR (70% of base 0.2 ATR)
- Ranging Market: TP1 = 0.10 ATR (50% of base)
- Choppy Market: TP1 = 0.06 ATR (30% of base) ≈ 3-6 pips

Config 2 (Scalping):
- Trending Market: TP1 = 0.05 ATR (50% of base 0.1 ATR)
- Ranging Market: TP1 = 0.03 ATR (30% of base)
- Choppy Market: TP1 = 0.02 ATR (20% of base) ≈ 1-2 pips ⚠️
```

**Why Such Small Take Profits in Choppy Markets?**

In choppy/ranging markets, price frequently reverses after small moves. The strategy adapts by:
- Taking profits as small as 1 pip (Config 2) or 3 pips (Config 1)
- Capturing many small wins before reversals occur
- Maintaining high win rates (60-70%) through quick exits
- Avoiding the risk of profits turning into losses

This is why you might see trades closing for just 1-2 pips profit - it's the strategy protecting capital in difficult market conditions!

#### Advanced Exit Management
1. **Three-Tier Take Profit**: Scales out 1/3 at each TP level
2. **TP1 Pullback Protection**: If 2 TPs hit and price pulls back to TP1, exit all
3. **Partial Profit Taking**: Secures profits before stop loss is hit
4. **Signal Flip Exit**: Config 2 exits on indicator reversal
5. **Trailing Stop**: Dynamically adjusts to protect profits

#### Position Sizing
- Fixed 1 million units per trade (standard forex lot)
- Intelligent sizing available but disabled by default
- Capital-adjusted sizing prevents over-leverage

### Monte Carlo Testing Files

#### monte_carlo_dual_strategy_test.py
- Tests both configurations on random 5,000-300,000 bar samples
- Default: 10-50 iterations per configuration
- Outputs detailed performance metrics and calendar year analysis
- Saves results to CSV with iteration details

#### multi_currency_monte_carlo.py
- Tests both configurations across multiple currency pairs
- Supported pairs: GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, NZDUSD, etc.
- 30 iterations per currency pair
- Identifies best currency-configuration combinations

### Why These Strategies Work

1. **Trend Alignment**: All 3 indicators must agree, filtering false signals
2. **Quick Profits**: Ultra-tight TPs capture small moves consistently
3. **Risk Control**: Maximum stop losses prevent large drawdowns
4. **Market Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustments based on market conditions
5. **Profit Protection**: Multiple exit mechanisms secure gains

### Performance Characteristics

**Config 1 (Ultra-Tight Risk):**
- Higher win rate (69.5%) due to tight TPs
- Larger position sizes (0.2% risk)
- Better for psychological comfort
- Holds positions longer

**Config 2 (Scalping):**
- Superior Sharpe ratio (1.437) 
- Lower drawdowns (-2.7% max)
- More trades (higher frequency)
- Quick exits on reversals

## ⚠️ Risk Disclaimer

Past performance does not guarantee future results. All trading involves risk of loss. The strategies should be paper traded extensively before live deployment. Continuous monitoring and risk management are essential.
