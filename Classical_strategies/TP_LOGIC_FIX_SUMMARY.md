# TP Logic Fix Summary - First Principles Approach

## Key Principles
1. **Original Position Size**: Never changes after entry (1M or 0.5M in relaxed mode)
2. **Remaining Size**: Tracks current position, decreases with each exit
3. **TP Exits**: Always exit 1/3 of ORIGINAL position, but never more than remaining

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. TP Routing Fix
**Problem**: TP exits were going through `_execute_partial_exit` which calculated exits as percentage of REMAINING position.

**Solution**: Route all TP exits through `_execute_full_exit` which has the correct logic:
```python
if 'take_profit' in str(exit_reason):
    # TP exits must go through _execute_full_exit for correct sizing
    completed_trade = self._execute_full_exit(...)
```

### 2. Clean TP Exit Logic
**Implementation**:
- TP1: Exit min(original/3, remaining) 
- TP2: Exit min(original/3, remaining)
- TP3: Exit all remaining

**Safety Features**:
- Prevent hitting same TP twice (check tp_index < trade.tp_hits)
- Safety check for exit_size > 0
- Warning messages for debug mode

### 3. Position Integrity
**Before**: 1M → 0.33M + 0.50M + 0.17M (wrong distribution)
**After**: 1M → 0.33M + 0.33M + 0.33M (correct distribution)

## Test Results
✅ Standard 1M position: TP1=0.333M, TP2=0.333M, TP3=0.333M
✅ Relaxed 0.5M position: TP1=0.167M, TP2=0.167M, TP3=0.167M
✅ Can't hit same TP twice
✅ Position integrity maintained (original = exits + remaining)
✅ Works with partial exits between TPs
