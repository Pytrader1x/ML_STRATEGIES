## Architecture

### Neural Network: C51 Dueling DQN with CNN-LSTM

The agent uses an advanced architecture combining multiple state-of-the-art components:

```
Input (State) → 1D CNN → LSTM → Dueling Networks → C51 Distribution
                  ↓       ↓           ↓                    ↓
              Feature   Temporal   Value/Advantage   51 atoms per action
              Extract   Modeling     Streams         (value distribution)
```

- **State Space**: 50 bars × 18 features + 9 position features = 909 dimensions
- **Action Space**: 4 discrete actions (0=Hold, 1=Buy, 2=Sell, 3=Close)
- **CNN**: Two 1D convolutional layers (64→128 filters) with batch norm
- **LSTM**: 2 layers, 64 hidden units, captures temporal dependencies
- **Dueling Streams**: Separate value and advantage pathways
- **C51 Output**: 51 atoms per action representing value distribution

### Memory: Prioritized Experience Replay

- **Simplified PER**: Efficient deque-based implementation
- **Priority Calculation**: α=0.75 for stronger prioritization
- **Importance Sampling**: β annealing from 0.4 to 1.0 over 20k steps
- **Warmup Period**: 5000 steps with uniform priorities
- **Capacity**: 50,000 transitions with n-step returns

## Rainbow Components Implemented

1. **Double DQN**: Decouples action selection and evaluation
2. **Dueling DQN**: Separate value and advantage streams
3. **Prioritized Replay**: TD-error based sampling
4. **N-Step Returns**: 3-step returns for better credit assignment
5. **C51**: Categorical distributional RL with 51 atoms
6. **NoisyNet**: Learnable parametric noise for exploration

## Technical Indicators

The agent uses sophisticated custom indicators:

1. **NeuroTrend Intelligent**: Dynamic trend detection with confidence
   - Direction, Confidence, SlopePower, ReversalRisk signals
2. **Market Bias**: Multi-timeframe directional bias
3. **Intelligent Chop**: Regime detection (trending vs ranging)
4. **Standard Indicators**: RSI, ATR, SMA crossovers
5. **Composite Signal**: Weighted combination of all indicators

## Trading Logic

### Position Management
- **Initial Balance**: USD 1,000,000
- **Position Size**: Fixed 1M AUDUSD units (dynamic sizing based on confidence implemented)
- **Max Positions**: 1 (strict one-trade-at-a-time enforcement)
- **Risk Management**: Adaptive SL/TP based on ATR and market regime

### Action Execution
- **Hold (0)**: No action
- **Buy (1)**: Open long position (only if no position)
- **Sell (2)**: Open short position (only if no position)
- **Close (3)**: Close current position early

### Exit Types (All Tracked)
- **Take Profit (TP)**: Price hits predetermined profit target
- **Stop Loss (SL)**: Price hits predetermined loss limit
- **Manual**: Episode end closures
- **Early**: Agent-initiated early exits (action 3)
