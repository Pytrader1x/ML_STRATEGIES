# NAV-Δ Reward Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the NAV-Δ (Mark-to-Market) reward system in the RL trading agent, replacing all "junk rewards" with a pure profit-aligned reward signal.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. NAV-Δ Reward Formula
```python
# Before action: NAV_{t-1} = B_{t-1} + U_{t-1}
nav_before = self.balance + (unrealized_pnl if position else 0)

# After action: NAV_t = B_t + U_t
nav_after = self.balance + (unrealized_pnl if position else 0)

# Reward = scaled change in NAV
reward = (nav_after - nav_before) / initial_balance * 1000
```

### 2. Removed All Junk Rewards
✅ **Removed entry bonuses** (+0.01 for "good signals")
✅ **Removed holding penalties** (-0.001 per bar)
✅ **Removed asymmetric scaling** (different multipliers for TP/SL)
✅ **Removed signal-following bonuses** (+0.05)
✅ **Removed large unrealized P&L multipliers** (×10)

### 3. Added Optional Components
- **Small constant time penalty**: -0.0001 per bar (encourages efficient exits)
- **Tiny capped shaping**: ±0.001 max for unrealized P&L (helps early training)

## Why This Matters

### Target Fidelity
- The Q-network now directly predicts future **dollar profit**
- No translation loss between reward and actual P&L
- Perfect alignment: `sign(gradient) = sign(P&L)`

### Eliminates Reward Hacking
- No auxiliary "cookie jars" for the agent to exploit
- Can't game the system by entering many trades for bonuses
- Can't profit from rewards while losing real money

### Handles Partial Exits Naturally
- If you scale out 50%: cash ↑, unrealized ↓, NAV stays ~same → reward ~0
- Agent learns partial exits are roughly breakeven

### Gradient Stability
- Small step rewards (sub-dollar scaled) prevent saturation
- Keeps optimizer in smooth regime
- Natural variance penalty favors smoother equity curves

## Implementation Details

### Location: `execute_action()` method (lines 378-538)
```python
def execute_action(self, action: int, index: int) -> Tuple[float, Dict]:
    """Execute trading action with NAV-Δ (Mark-to-Market) reward system
    
    Reward Philosophy:
    - Reward = scaled change in net asset value (NAV)
    - NAV = cash balance + unrealized P&L
    - No junk rewards, no entry bonuses, no asymmetric scaling
    - Pure alignment with actual trading profitability
    """
```

### Key Properties
1. **Symmetric scaling**: Same multiplier for wins and losses
2. **Pure P&L alignment**: Rewards directly track dollar changes
3. **No biases**: No inherent preference for long vs short
4. **Clean learning signal**: Removes noise from arbitrary bonuses

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Test NAV-Δ Path
- Feed known price series
- Verify: Σ rewards = PnL ÷ scale ± 1 cent

### 2. Back-run with ε=0
- Use scripted policy (buy then sell after N bars)
- Ensure recorded rewards = hand-calculated profit

### 3. Layer Optional Components
- Add capped shaping if learning stalls
- Add time penalty if trades exceed 100 bars
- Always verify: sign(PnL) == sign(total reward)

## Results

The agent's gradient updates now row in the same direction as the brokerage statement. This fundamental alignment ensures:
- Training optimizes for **actual trading profitability**
- No conflicting objectives or perverse incentives
- Experience replay and network depth become true optimization tools

## Fixed Error

Also fixed the Sharpe ratio calculation error in testing:
- Removed DatetimeIndex dependency
- Calculate directly from bar returns
- Proper annualization: √(252 × 96) for 15-minute bars
