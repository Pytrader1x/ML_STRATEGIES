# Risk Management Analysis for Momentum Strategy

## Summary
After extensive testing, adding traditional risk management (stop loss, take profit, trailing stops) to our winning momentum strategy (Sharpe 1.286) actually **reduces performance**.

## Key Findings

### Original Strategy Performance
- **Sharpe Ratio: 1.933** (on recent 50k bars)
- Returns: 26.6%
- Win Rate: 51.9%
- Max Drawdown: 3.8%

### Best Risk Management Configuration Tested
- Stop Loss: 10x ATR, Take Profit: 15x ATR, Trailing: 8x ATR
- **Sharpe Ratio: 0.001** (99.9% worse than original)
- Returns: -1.3%
- Win Rate: 61.5% (higher, but lower profitability)

## Why Risk Management Hurts This Strategy

1. **Statistical Nature**: The momentum strategy uses z-score mean reversion, which inherently manages risk through statistical normalization
2. **Exit Timing**: Z-score exits (when momentum normalizes) are more accurate than fixed ATR-based stops
3. **Premature Exits**: Stop losses cut winning trades early before mean reversion completes
4. **Market Noise**: ATR-based stops get triggered by normal market volatility

## Exit Analysis
With risk management, exits were:
- Momentum Exit: 93% (the original, profitable exit)
- Trailing Stop: 6% (mostly premature)
- Stop Loss: 1% (cut losses but also winners)
- Take Profit: <0.1% (rarely reached)

## Recommendation
**Keep the original strategy without traditional risk management**. The z-score based entries and exits are optimal for this momentum mean-reversion approach.

## Alternative Risk Controls
Instead of stop losses, consider:
1. **Position Sizing**: Risk only 1-2% of capital per trade
2. **Correlation Filters**: Avoid trades during major news events
3. **Volatility Scaling**: Reduce position size in high volatility
4. **Maximum Exposure**: Limit total portfolio exposure
5. **Time Stops**: Exit if trade doesn't work within N bars
