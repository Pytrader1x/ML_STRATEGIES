# 📊 Crypto Trading Strategy Performance Report

**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Asset:** ETH/USD (Kraken Data)  
**Data Period:** 2015-08-07 to 2025-03-31  
**Strategy Type:** Percentage-based adaptation of FX strategy

---

## Executive Summary

We successfully adapted the high-Sharpe FX trading strategies to work with cryptocurrency markets by converting from pip-based to percentage-based calculations. The crypto adaptation shows mixed results with some profitable periods but overall negative Sharpe ratios in the current configuration.

### Key Findings
- **Conservative Config**: Average Sharpe -0.269, 65% win rate
- **Aggressive Config**: Average Sharpe -1.399, 60.9% win rate  
- **25% of Conservative tests** achieved Sharpe > 1.0
- **Realistic returns**: -0.1% to -0.4% average per test
- **Low drawdowns**: Maximum -0.7%

## 1. Strategy Adaptation Details

### From FX to Crypto: Key Changes

| Component | FX Version | Crypto Version | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Price Units** | Pips (0.0001) | Percentages (%) | Crypto has no standard pip concept |
| **Stop Loss** | 10-20 pips | 1.5-3% | Adjusted for crypto volatility |
| **Take Profit** | 20-50 pips | 3-6% | Wider targets for volatile markets |
| **Risk per Trade** | 0.1-0.2% | 0.1-0.2% | Kept similar for consistency |
| **Position Sizing** | Fixed pip risk | Percentage-based | Dynamic sizing based on volatility |

### Technical Implementation
```python
# FX Version (pip-based)
sl_max_pips = 10.0  # 10 pips stop loss

# Crypto Version (percentage-based)  
sl_max_pct = 0.015  # 1.5% stop loss
```

- **Max Stop Loss**: 1.5%
- **Target Profit**: 3% max

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Average Sharpe Ratio | -1.399 | Poor |
| Average Return | -0.4% | Negative |
| Win Rate | 60.9% | Acceptable |

## 3. Technical Indicators Performance

The custom indicators (NTI, MB, IC) work correctly on crypto data:

- **NTI (NeuroTrend Intelligent)**: Captures major trends effectively
- **MB (Market Bias)**: Provides directional confirmation
- **IC (Intelligent Chop)**: Filters out ranging markets

However, the entry/exit logic may need crypto-specific optimization.

## 4. Comparison with Simple Test Results

Our earlier simple momentum test showed:
- **2022 Bear Market**: Sharpe 2.573 (exceptional)
- **2020-2021 Bull**: Sharpe 0.795 (good)

This suggests the core indicators work but the complex entry/exit logic needs tuning.

---

## 5. Risk Analysis

### Strengths
- **Excellent risk control**: Max drawdown < 1%
- **Consistent win rates**: 60-65%
- **No catastrophic losses**: Strategy exits work properly
- **Realistic returns**: No unrealistic P&L values

### Weaknesses  
- **Negative average Sharpe**: Current parameters not optimal
- **Aggressive config underperforms**: Tighter stops get hit too often
- **Limited edge**: Strategy struggles in crypto's unique market dynamics

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Widen stop losses**: Test 5-10% stops for crypto volatility
2. **Adjust entry filters**: Crypto trends differently than FX
3. **Time-based filters**: Consider crypto's 24/7 nature
4. **Volume indicators**: Add volume confirmation for entries

### Strategic Considerations
1. **Market regime detection**: Crypto has distinct bull/bear cycles
2. **Volatility adaptation**: Dynamic parameter adjustment
3. **Exchange-specific tuning**: Different exchanges have different dynamics
4. **Fee optimization**: Crypto fees can be higher than FX

## 7. Code Quality & Validation

### ✅ Successful Adaptations
- Percentage-based calculations work correctly
- Position sizing scales appropriately  
- Risk management functions properly
- No look-ahead bias or cheating

## 8. Conclusion

The FX-to-crypto adaptation is technically successful - the strategy runs correctly with realistic results. However, the current parameters are not optimal for crypto markets. The negative Sharpe ratios indicate the need for crypto-specific parameter optimization rather than direct parameter translation from FX.

### Next Steps
1. Parameter optimization specifically for crypto volatility patterns
2. Backtesting on individual crypto market regimes (bull/bear/accumulation)
3. Integration of crypto-specific indicators (on-chain metrics, funding rates)
4. Multi-exchange data validation

### Final Assessment
**Status**: Technically validated but requires optimization  
**Production Ready**: No - needs parameter tuning  
**Recommended Action**: Run optimization study with wider parameter ranges
