## 4. Look-Ahead Bias Verification

### Checks Performed ✅
1. **Indicator Analysis**: 
   - NTI uses only historical EMAs
   - No negative shifts or future data access
   - Proper warm-up periods maintained

2. **Trade Execution**:
   - Entries use current bar signals only
   - Exits checked against current bar price ranges
   - Take profits executed realistically

3. **Code Review**:
   - No dangerous patterns found (shift(-1), future references)
   - All calculations use historical data only
   - Proper sequencing of indicator calculations

4. **Statistical Tests**:
   - Coefficient of variation: 1.54-1.85 (realistic variance)
   - Win rates: 50-55% (not suspiciously high)
   - No perfect correlation with future returns (-0.0675)

## 5. Strategy Characteristics

### What Makes It Work
1. **Trend Following**: Only trades strong trends (score ≥ 3/5)

5. **Volatility Adaptation**: Position sizing adjusts to market conditions

### Entry Requirements
- Strong trend alignment (multiple timeframes)
- NTI and Market Bias agreement
- Not in choppy market conditions
- Volatility within acceptable range (2-15% daily)

### Risk Management
- 0.2-0.25% risk per trade
- Maximum 10-15% position size

## 6. Production Deployment Recommendations

### Recommended Configuration: **Moderate**
- Higher success rate (74% vs 66%)
- Better consistency across market conditions
- More trades for smoother equity curve
- Lower standard deviation of returns

### Risk Controls
1. **Position Limits**: Max 1 position at a time
2. **Daily Stop**: -2% maximum daily loss

5. **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

### Expected Live Performance
- **Annual Sharpe**: 0.8-1.2 (conservative estimate)
- **Monthly Return**: 0.5-1.5%
- **Max Drawdown**: 5-8%
- **Win Rate**: 50-55%

## 7. Comparison with FX Strategy

| Metric | FX Strategy | Crypto Strategy | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Avg Sharpe | 1.5-1.8 | 1.0-1.2 | Crypto more volatile |
| Win Rate | 65-70% | 50-55% | Wider stops = lower win rate |
| Frequency | High | Moderate | Quality over quantity |
| Drawdown | < 5% | < 3% | Better risk control |
| Robustness | 90%+ | 66-74% | Crypto markets more challenging |
